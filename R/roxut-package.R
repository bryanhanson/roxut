#' Much as `roxygen2` allows one to document functions in the same file
#' as the function itself, `roxut` allows one to write the unit tests
#' in the same file as the function.  Once processed, the unit tests are
#' moved to the appropriate directory.  Currently supports `testthat` and
#' `tinytest` frameworks.  The `roxygen2` package provides much of the infrastructure.
